# LEARNING NOTES

Why am I doing this? Taking good notes is an important part of any learning process. Actively taking notes while learning can help you focus and better understand main concepts. In many classes, you may be asked to watch an instructional video before a class discussion. Note taking will improve active listening, comprehension of material, and retention. Taking notes on both synchronous and asynchronous material will help you better remember what you hear and see.

These learning notes consist of things I learned through my career. I was inspired by a former colleague of mine [Maarten Michiels](https://github.com/mistermicheels) and his project [Learning notes](https://github.com/mistermicheels/learning-notes).
