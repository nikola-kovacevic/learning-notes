# LEARNING NOTES

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/d5123d3c-5d1f-479f-b476-6c584f0c3848/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/nk-learning-notes/deploys)

Why am I doing this? Taking good notes is an important part of any learning process. Actively taking notes while learning helps me focus and better understand the main concepts. In many classes, you may be asked to watch an instructional video before a class discussion. Note taking will improve active listening, comprehension of material, and retention. Taking notes on both synchronous and asynchronous material will help you better remember what you hear and see.

These learning notes are structured by topic and consist of things I learned through my career. I will add new items to this repository as I learn them. The main idea is that I structure my thoughts as I learn new things, and as I reflect on previous knowledge.

## Inspiration

I was inspired by a former colleague of mine [Maarten Michiels](https://github.com/mistermicheels) and his [learning notes project](https://learning-notes.mistermicheels.com/).
